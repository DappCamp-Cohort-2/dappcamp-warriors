# DappCamp Warriors

### Warriors Generator
warriors-generator contains all the scripts and assets to generate the ~2.2K warriors. It uses p5.js to draw hat, character, and weapon charts on the canvas element in the browser and then takes a snapshot of the canvas to generate the image. 
Currently,  the ~2.2K images take ~12 minutes to generate. 
1. Open warriors-generator/index.html in a local development server mode (like with VS Code Live Server)
1. Images will start getting generated when you open the index.html file. Keep the browser tab open until all the images get generated.
